# CS310 LinkedList Implementation (Java)

### Warning!
If you are currently in Alan Riggins CS 310 class, please do not use this code. This is for two reasons:
- Professor Riggins often changes small aspects of the program to catch people attempting to do exactly this
- It defeats the purpose of actually taking the class, you will not learn anything from coping. 

### Project information
- Author: Andrew Black
- Class: CS 310
- Professor: Alan Riggins (San Diego State University)
- Purpose:
    - To develop a LinkedList class in java
    - To develop this class without using any prexisting data structure libraries

### How do I test the code?
Download the files in this repository and copy them into your working directory. Please make sure that the file structure is exactly the same as it appears in this repository, as most of the essential code is in the "data_structures" package. Test the code using the "P2Driver.java" file as the main class file. 

"P2Driver.java" is an extensive driver written by me, Andrew Black, to test my LinkedList implementation before turning it in. Professor Riggins did not provide a test driver for this program, and did not provide the grading driver as he commonly does. 

### Who wrote which files?

- LinearList.java
- Queue.java
- Stack.java

Files Written by Professor Alan Riggins:
