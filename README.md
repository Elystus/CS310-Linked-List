# CS310 LinkedList Implementation

### Warning!
If you are currently in Alan Riggins CS 310 class, please do not use this code. This is for two reasons:
- Professor Riggins often changes small aspects of the program to catch people attempting to do exactly this
- It defeats the purpose of actually taking the class, you will not learn anything from coping.
